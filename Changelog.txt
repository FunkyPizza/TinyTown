22/03/2019
- Added Dijkstra pathfinding as Pathfinding component.
- Implemented pathfinding componenent to PlayerGridCamera.

25/03/2019
- Can no longer build on tiles that have already been built on.
- Added a SpawnBlockAtStartTile(), but need to adjust block relative location again on spawn 

26/03/2019
- Started implementing zone block spawning
- Carried on implementing pathfinding Dijkstra (added actual tile costs)

27/03/2019
- Fixed and tweaked Dijkstra Pathfinding 
- Started implementing A* pathfinding

28/03/2019
- Progress on A*, somehow doesn't work fully depending on goal tile.

29/03/2019
- Finished implementing A*

1/04/2019

02/04/2019
- Added day and night cycle

03/04/2019
- Added time logic with controls in UI
- Based day and night cycle on this time system

08/04/2019
- Pathfinding will no longer find paths by going to the top edge of the grid and carrying on at the bottom of the next row 
- Ghost blocks no longer hover over used tiles (preventing that they can be placed on it)
- road building now uses a mix of Dijkstra's and A* to find best path

09/04/2014
- Added a new "block type" var in database to assign a building to its type
- Category Name in database is now only used for UI purposes, Block_Type now defines a block's behaviour
- Added building material with lights going on and off
- Improved pathfinding perfomance (does not run on tick anymore)
